# Hi, I am Deepanshu (Alucard2169 **😋**)

I am a college student majoring in __Computer science engineering__, I am currently learning Web Development. 
Whenever i see some cool designs i try to recreate them in my own way, I like interesting effects and animations to designs.
I learned HTML, CSS, SCSS, by myself and currently learning *Javascript*.

If you have any tips or advice for me then i really appreciate it.

## I often do coding and design challenges
