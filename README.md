Hi, I am Deepanshu (Alucard2169 ðŸ˜‹) I am a college student majoring in Computer science engineering, I am currently learning Web Development. 
Whenever i see some cool designs i trie to recreate them in my own way, I like interesting effects and animations to designs.
I learned HTML, CSS, SCSS, by myself and currently learning Javascript.

If you have any tips or advice for me then i really appreciate it.

Thank you.
